I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years ago**, specializing in **Front-End Development** with frameworks like **Next.js** and **React.js**. I focus on building responsive, dynamic, and scalable web applications, with **UI/UX Design** as a supporting skill.

## Front-End Developer

I specialize in developing interactive and high-quality user interfaces for modern web applications. My projects often include:

- Building **responsive and dynamic web applications**,
- Developing **dashboard layouts** and data-driven UI,
- Implementing **CMS-based systems**,
- Optimizing web performance and ensuring seamless **user experiences**.
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### JavaScript (ES6+)

JavaScript is an essential part of my toolkit, enabling me to build interactive and engaging web applications. It’s the programming language I’m most familiar with and have been using consistently across all projects.

### TypeScript

Recently, I’ve started incorporating **TypeScript** into my development workflow. I’m currently getting more familiar with its features and benefits, particularly in enhancing type safety and maintaining scalable codebases.

### React

React is my core library for building **single-page applications**. Over the past **2+ years**, I’ve used it in multiple projects to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### Next.js

I’ve been leveraging **Next.js** for projects requiring **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **dynamic imports**, and SEO-optimized features. Its versatility has significantly improved my development workflows.

### Tailwind CSS

For styling, I use **Tailwind CSS** for its simplicity and efficiency. It’s become my go-to solution for building responsive and clean UI components, complementing my earlier experience with SCSS and traditional CSS.

### Material UI and Ant Design

I’m proficient with **Material UI** and **Ant Design** for building modern, professional user interfaces, especially in projects that require standardized design systems.

## UI/UX Design (Supporting Skill)

While UI/UX design is not my primary focus, I often collaborate with designers and contribute to creating user-friendly interfaces. Tools like **Figma** and **Photoshop** help me in refining layouts and ensuring that designs align with technical requirements.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
